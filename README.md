This repository contains [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/)-based symbolic models for a number of state-of-the-art **distance bounding protocols**. Such protocols are cryptogrphic protocols that, in addition to authentication, are meant to guarantee physical proximity between the principals.

For further details see our [S\&P 2018](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/) paper [Distance-Bounding Protocols: Verification without Time and Location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VtMDUKLYr8BTgKy8aSjLG-UBS8VcKcuR/view).
